## Subspace Client Library

The subspace client is a javascript library that can run in a Node JS or Web Browser environment.  It allows you to build a client side application for web, mobile, or desktop apps running on the subspace protocol.

Subspace is a decentralized NoSQL database, or key-value store, that has a simple get(), put() API. Data hosted on subspace is sharded across a network of persistent mobile devices.  Subspace hosts set aside local disk space in order to earn subspace credits, which they receive for hosting and serving data for subspace apps.  Subspace allows you as a developer to quickly build secure decentralized applications without having to:

1. Design your own cryptograhic database
2. Createa a P2P overlay network
3. Handle distributed consensus
4. Create your own cyrpto-token incentives
5. Bootstrap a persistent peer network

Why build decentralized apps?  

1. It is more secure, using public key cryptography, encryption, and digital signatures
2. It is more reliable, since data is highly replicated and self-healing
3. Users can fully own their data by covering the hosting costs.
4. Users can pay you in credits they earn from devices they already own.
5. You dont have to worry about managing infrastructere, subspace manages that. 


To learn more about the how the subspace protocols works you can review the [architecture guide]() or read our [white paper]().

## Subspace Developer Console

Start by visiting the [subspace console](https://console.getsubspace.io) to setup your developer account and create a storage contract.  You will receive one subspace credit for signing up, which allows you to create a 1 GB / month storage contract for testing purposes purposes. 

1. Create an new subspace developer account
2. Safely store your key pair
3. Create a new app and storage contract

## Can I test it out without creating a developer account?

Absolutely!  Install the subpace app on your mobile phone, setup a personal storage contract and get the contract id.  Now you can test your app on your own phone

## Include subspace in your app

Using NPM

$ npm install subspace-client
